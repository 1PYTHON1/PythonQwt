    Written by Pierre Raybaut

      The ``python-qwt`` project was initiated to solve -at least temporarily- 
      the obsolescence issue of `PyQwt` (the Python-Qwt C++ bindings library) 
      which is no longer maintained. The idea was to translate the Qwt C++ code 
      to Python and then to optimize some parts of the code by writing new 
      modules based on NumPy and other libraries.
      
      The ``python-qwt`` project consists of a single Python package named `qwt` 
      and of a few other files (examples, doc, ...).

      The `qwt` Python package was partly (95%) translated from Qwt C++ library: 
      the associated code is licensed under the terms of the Qwt license 1.0 
      (see qwt/QwtLicense, Copyright (C) 2002 Uwe Rathmann). The rest of the 
      code was wrote from scratch and is licensed under the terms of the MIT 
      License (see qwt/LICENSE).

    Overview

      The `qwt` package is a pure Python implementation of Qwt C++ library with
      the following limitations.

      The following `Qwt` classes won't be reimplemented in `qwt` because most 
      powerful features already exist in `guiqwt`:
        - QwtPlotZoomer
        - QwtCounter
        - QwtEventPattern
        - QwtPicker
        - QwtPlotPicker

      QwtClipper is not implemented yet (and it will probably be very difficult
      or impossible to implement it in pure Python without performance issues).
      As a consequence, when zooming in a plot curve, the entire curve is still
      painted (in other words, when working with large amount of data, there is
      no performance gain when zooming in).
