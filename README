      The `qwt` package is a pure Python implementation of Qwt C++ library with
      the following limitations.

      The following `Qwt` classes won't be reimplemented in `qwt` because most 
      powerful features already exist in `guiqwt`:
        - QwtPlotZoomer
        - QwtCounter
        - QwtEventPattern
        - QwtPicker
        - QwtPlotPicker
